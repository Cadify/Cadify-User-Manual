Getting Started with Cadify

This manual is your technical reference for working with Cadify. It provides the knowledge you need to configure products, manage CAD logic, and ensure production data is correct from the start.

Before you begin, verify that you have access to Cadify and the required integrations, including SolidWorks and Excel. Once your environment is ready, we will guide you through the essentials: logging in, navigating the interface, and understanding how configuration rules, documentation, and production data link together through the digital twin.

Use this section to establish a solid foundation. With these basics in place, you can focus on building, automating, and scaling your product configurations with confidence.
