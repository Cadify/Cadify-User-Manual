# Service Introduction

Cadify connects design, sales, and production in one flow. Engineers define products in SolidWorks with a linked Excel workbook. Customers then configure those products directly in the web store. Every choice is captured and turned into a complete digital twin: 3D model, drawings, BOM, and files.

The Service layer keeps everything in sync, using secure cloud storage to update models and publish results. ERP and MES systems receive the full production package, ready for manufacturing.

The result is simple: what customers choose online becomes production-ready documentation that is always correct and always on time.
