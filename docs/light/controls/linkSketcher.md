## Sketcher Output Publication

Sketcher Sheets can be published to the web through **Web Controls**.  
Each control defines what content appears on the product page or in the browser preview.

### To add a Sketcher Output

1. Open the **Task Pane → Web Controls**.  
2. Click **Add** to create a new Web Control.  
3. In the new control’s settings, choose **Output = Sketcher** and select which **Named Sketcher** to link.  
4. Publish your project and verify that the generated **SVG drawing** appears on the product page or in the sandbox preview.

> **Note:**  
> If no Web Control is linked to the Sketcher, the Named Sketcher will not be included in the online view.  
> Always verify Output mapping before publishing.  
>  
> **Tip:** The name of the Named Sketcher appears as the label on the corresponding web tab.
