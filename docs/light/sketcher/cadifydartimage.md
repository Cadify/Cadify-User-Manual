# 🖼️ CadifyDartImage

The `CadifyDartImage` function sends a JSON prompt to an external ML service and inserts the generated image into your Excel sheet.

## 📌 What It Does
When you enter this function into a cell, it posts the provided JSON (from `CadifyDartJson`) to the Dart/Floris API and places the returned image at the specified location in your worksheet.

## 🧾 Syntax

```excel
=CadifyDartImage(json, jsonType, target)
```

## 🧮 Parameters

| Parameter   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `json`      | JSON string, typically from `CadifyDartJson` |
| `jsonType`  | Type of JSON/ML request.<br>**Currently, only `1` (Floris) is supported** |
| `target`    | Excel cell reference (e.g., `"B2"`) for the top-left corner of the image |

## ✅ Example

```excel
=CadifyDartImage(A2, 1, "B2")
```

Where cell `A2` contains the JSON generated by `CadifyDartJson(1)`.

## 🔁 Behavior
- Synchronously sends the JSON to the Dart/Floris API and waits for a response.
- Inserts the returned image as an Excel picture at the `target` cell location.
- Each function call generates a new image; previous images are deleted automatically.
- Returns a status message indicating how long it took to retrieve the image from the service.

## 🔒 Notes
- Only `jsonType = 1` is currently supported (Floris image generation).
- Requires internet access and a valid API key.
- The image file is temporarily stored and deleted after insertion.
- For best results, ensure the JSON is correctly formatted and the target cell is visible.
