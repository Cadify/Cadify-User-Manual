# Your storefront, our headless engine

Cadify connects to NopCommerce through the official Web API. NopCommerce manages catalog, pricing, and projects in the backend, while your storefront consumes the APIs. Cadify adds configuration logic and supplies production-ready data directly into the commerce process.
