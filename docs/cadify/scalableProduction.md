# Scalable Production

## Introduction

Cadify is a digital platform that combines 3D modeling, CAD automation, and digital twin technology in the browser. It transforms customer choices into production-ready documentation, always correct, always on time. The key to scalable production is flexibility: the knowledge of how products are adapted for different processes is embedded in the setup. This ensures that each order, no matter the volume or variation, produces the right documentation without extra engineering.

## Production-ready Documentation

Every drawing, BOM, and machine file is automatically updated when product parameters change. This eliminates manual rework and ensures that the first version is always correct. Cadify links engineering knowledge directly to production data, turning complexity into flow.

## Dynamic BOM and Reports

The Bill of Materials is generated directly from the digital twin and updated in real time. It becomes a single source of truth for engineering, procurement, and production. Reports provide live insights into cost, material usage, and capacity, supporting both small batch and large-scale series.

## Capacity Management and Integration

Cadify integrates with ERP and MES systems to deliver complete order data automatically. This enables capacity planning without manual coordination. Whether scaling up or down, production stays aligned with available resources and customer demand, maintaining both flow and profitability.
