# Cadify Task Pane

Cadify’s Task Pane unifies every stage of product creation, providing a single workspace for design, documentation, and interactive web experiences. The 3D Model tab links SolidWorks models directly to Cadify MASTER for accurate, manufacturable customization. The Drawing tab keeps technical drawings dynamically updated, ensuring precise dimensions, annotations, and production-ready details. The Web tab transforms configurations into engaging, browser-based experiences with fully tested controls and live previews. Together, these tabs streamline collaboration, reduce errors, and maintain data integrity from concept through customer interaction—so every product version is validated, consistent, and ready for manufacturing or online presentation without extra rework.
