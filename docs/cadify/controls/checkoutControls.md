# Cadify Checkout Web Controls

Cadify Checkout Web Controls define the permitted actions for each product. These controls guide how a configured product can be used or processed.  

Typical controls include:  

- Make Drawings
- Add to Project
- One-Click Request for Quote

These functions ensure that every configured product follows the correct steps. The process becomes structured, predictable, and always aligned with the permitted workflow.
