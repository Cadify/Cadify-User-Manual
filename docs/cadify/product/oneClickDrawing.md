### Configuration Options

When you trigger the command, you will be presented with a decision:

-   **Automatic Dimensions (Yes/No)**:
    -   **Yes**: Cadify will attempt to automatically insert and arrange model dimensions onto the drawing views.
    -   **No**: The drawing will be created with the standard views, but you can manually add dimensions later if needed.

### Standard Template

One-Click Drawing uses a pre-defined template to ensure consistency:

-   **Template Name**: `Cadify A4 EN Portrait.DRWDOT`
-   **Sheet Size**: A4
-   **Orientation**: Portrait

## ⚡ Benefits
