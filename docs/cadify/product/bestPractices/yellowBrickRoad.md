# Yellow Brick Road

The Yellow Brick Road is a best practice for structuring product databases in Cadify. It introduces a consistent worksheet layout, with row 40 marked in yellow as the reference line for the active variant. All tables are placed below, and all helper data above. This approach simplifies expansion of large models and makes it easier to trace changes and errors in shared workbooks.
