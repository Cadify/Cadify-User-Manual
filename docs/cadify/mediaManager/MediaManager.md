# Media Manager Documentation

This document describes the Media Manager tool used for managing product-related media in Cadify. The Media Manager allows users to set up printing areas from Excel workbooks, configure downloadable PDF brochures, and manage product picturesâ€”all controlled via proxy objects in the code and stored in structured Excel worksheets.

## Overview

The Media Manager UI is divided into three main sections:

- **Print from Excel**: Configure print areas from specified worksheets and ranges.
- **PDF from File**: Set up downloadable PDF brochures for products.
- **Pictures**: Manage product images and associate them with controls.

## Excel Data Mapping

The configuration for each media type is stored in a structured format in the Excel workbook. Each section uses a proxy object:
- `ProxyReport` for print areas
- `ProxyBrochure` for PDF brochures
- `ProxyPicture` for product images

The following example shows how these proxies are stored in the Excel workbook:

## Proxy Object Mapping

- **ProxyReport**: Defines Excel printing areas.
- **ProxyBrochure**: Defines downloadable PDF brochures.
- **ProxyPicture**: Defines product images and their attributes.

Each proxy is represented as a structured row in the Excel workbook, making it easy to configure and automate media management for products.

### Workflow Summary

1. **Configure print areas** in Excel via `ProxyReport`.
2. **Add downloadable PDFs** via `ProxyBrochure`.
3. **Assign and connect images** via `ProxyPicture` and link them to controls (e.g., ImageSquares).

## UI Actions

- **Add PDF print**: Add a new Excel print configuration.
- **Add PDF as file**: Attach a downloadable PDF brochure.
- **Add picture**: Add new product images and associate them with controls.

Buttons at the bottom allow users to validate and apply changes, ensuring the product's media settings are correctly saved.
