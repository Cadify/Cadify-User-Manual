# Cadify textures

Folder name: `cadify textures`

Purpose
- Holds SolidWorks appearance resources: texture images, color files, and appearance definitions.
- Used by SolidWorks to assign materials, colors, and appearances to parts and assemblies.

Key points
- Created automatically during Cadify installation.
- Do not rename this folder — SolidWorks expects this folder name to locate appearance resources.
- Files placed here are automatically synchronized to Dropbox and other synced machines when a sync agent is active.

Typical file types
- Texture images (`.bmp`, `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)
- Appearance/definition files used by SolidWorks
- Color or metadata files required by the appearance system

Usage
- Add or update textures by copying them into this folder. The sync agent uploads changes automatically.
- Changes made on other machines will be downloaded here and become available in SolidWorks after sync.
