## Publishing a Sketcher Output

The Sketcher renders live **Cadify UDF** content in Excel, but these are **not published automatically**.  
To make your Sketcher visible in the browser, you must link it as an **Output** in the **Web Controls** panel.

### Quick Steps

1. Open **Web Controls** from the **Task Pane**.  
2. Click **Add → Output = Sketcher**.  
3. Re-publish your project to **cadify.gratis** or your connected commerce site.

> **Note:**  
> If no Web Control is linked to the Sketcher, the Named Sketcher will not be included in the online view.  
> Always verify Output mapping before publishing.  
>  
> **Tip:** The name of the Named Sketcher appears as the label on the corresponding web tab.
