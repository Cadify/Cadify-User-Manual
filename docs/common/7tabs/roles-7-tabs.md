# Cadify 7 Tab Role System Documentation

This chapter summarizes fixed product tabs, role mapping, localization, content management, drawing settings, and store‑admin workflows.

> **Context:** PARA 4 is designed as a landing paragraph from Home Page buttons that link directly to “document access and roles.”

## Fixed Product Tabs and Functionality

### 1 Description
Shows the **nopCommerce Full Description** text. Fixed mapping; cannot contain other files. Content is defined in **SolidWorks Task Pane → Tools → Product Settings → General Information**.

### 2 Specifications
Presents all **Cadify Web Controls** of type **Output** (configurable specification attributes and their values).

### 3 Brochures
Contains static documents (e.g., PDF brochures/manuals). A document may be assigned to none, any, or all tabs at the creator’s discretion.

### 4 Customers
Holds reports/files generated from Cadify Master Excel or CAD process intended for end customers.

### 5 Partner
Holds files generated from the Cadify 3D model intended for partner‑level sharing.

### 6 Fabricator
Contains files intended for manufacturing vendors (e.g., CNC files, flat patterns, BOM reports).

### 7 SourceAdmin
Reserved for sensitive/core files such as SolidWorks Pack‑and‑Go archives or the Cadify Master Excel file. Access is restricted to **SourceAdmin** and **Store Owners**.

## Role‑Based Visibility and Access

### Tab–Role Mapping
Each tab corresponds to a nopCommerce role of the same name for controlled access.

### Role Defaults
- **Public:** Tabs 1–3 (Description, Specifications, Brochures)
- **Customers:** Tab 4 + Store Owner
- **Partner:** Tab 5 + Store Owner
- **Fabricator:** Tab 6 + Store Owner
- **SourceAdmin:** Tab 7 + Store Owner

### Permissions
Roles with tab access can both view **and** download files.

### Admin vs Store Owner
- **Admin:** Unlimited access across all stores and admin functions; implicitly has all Store Owner rights.
- **Store Owner:** Admin of a single store/substore (e.g., `substore.cadify.no`); unlimited number of substores.

## Localization and Naming

### Tab Labels
Tab names are nopCommerce localization strings and include the sequence number, e.g., `1: Description`, `2: Specifications`, …, `7: SourceAdmin`.

### Language Packs
Tab names can be translated or renamed using nopCommerce language packs.

## Content Management Structure

### Introduction
Cadify aligns customer choices, engineering rules, and production requirements across seven fixed tabs:
1. **Description** — full description
2. **Specifications** — output attributes (web controls)
3. **Brochures** — static brochures/reference docs
4. **Customers** — customer‑facing reports
5. **Partner** — partner collaboration files
6. **Fabricator** — vendor/manufacturing files
7. **SourceAdmin** — restricted source files

Tabs present only relevant information to each stakeholder and ensure consistent, updated inputs for production.

### File Assignment
Any file can be assigned to none, any, or all of the seven tabs by the document creator (Proxy or Task Pane UI).

### Store Owner
Controls which roles have access to tabs by assigning customer roles. Content is always defined by the document creator.

### Empty Tabs
Tabs without assigned content are hidden on the product page.

## Proxy UI in SolidWorks

### Overview
**Task Pane → Web (Proxy)** lets engineers assign **Reports**, **Brochures**, and **Models** to any tab.

### Reports
Configure: source sheet, print area, destination tab, file name, display order.

### Brochures
Assign static files (PDFs, etc.) to any tab; control sequence via display order.

### Pictures
For **Cadify Web Controls only**; not assignable to tabs.

### Models
Generate model files (e.g., STL, 3MF, ZIP) and place them on any tab.

## Web Controls for Specifications

### Output Controls
Each Output control defines:
- Output attribute name
- Value
- Display order
- Description (HTML supported)
- Optional/required
- Filtering rules
- Optional graphic

### Input/Output/Checkout
Only **Output** controls appear in **Specifications**.

### Checkout Controls
Used for ordering workflows only; not tied to tab roles/content.

## Product General Information

### UI
Defined by the SW Engineer in **Task Pane → Tools → Product Settings → General Information**.

### Fields
- Product name
- Short description
- **Full description** (Tab 1 content)
- SKU
- Published status
- Admin comment

## Drawing Settings and Role Assignment

### Drawing Settings UI
In **Task Pane → Tools → Drawings → Settings for Drawings**, configure output settings per drawing. A product may have multiple drawings.

### Role Assignment
For each drawing, select any/all roles (Customers, Partner, Fabricator, SourceAdmin) and assign document types (DWG, DXF, PDF) to tabs.

### Drawing Files
- A drawing may include unlimited sheets.
- All sheets are managed within a single file.
- Styles, margins, prompts are defined in this UI.

### Display Order
Engineers control the sequence of drawings within selected tabs.

## Customer Role Assignment in Store Admin

### UI
In **nopCommerce Admin → Customers → Select Customer**, the Store Owner assigns roles; the Cadify Plugin adds roles for Tabs 4–7.

### Store Owner Label
Store Owner roles are substore‑specific, e.g., `substore.cadify.no`.

### Separation of Responsibility
- **Document creator:** Chooses tab placement for each file/report/drawing.
- **Store Owner:** Assigns customer roles to determine access.

## Implementation Notes

### Database Structure
- **Tabs** table stores definitions for Tabs 2–7. (Tab 1 is implicit.)
- **CustomerRoleTabMapping** links products, roles, and tabs for visibility control.

### Defaults
Default access follows the role mapping above.

### Admin Interface
nopCommerce admin **Customer Roles** are extended with tab access checkboxes.

### Frontend Display
Tabs render only if they contain content **and** the current user role has access.
