# Core Components

## Cadify Desktop
A SolidWorks add-in with Excel integration. Engineers define rules and models in a single workbook per product. Drawings and 3D models are governed together and always regenerate correctly.

## Cadify Web

## Cadify Service
Coordinates updates between Desktop, Web, and cloud storage. It tracks changes, updates models, regenerates drawings, exports 3D formats, and uploads results.

## Dropbox Cloud
Secure storage provided per client location. Ensures tenant isolation and reliable synchronization.

## ERP / MES / PLM
Receives the complete BOM, governed drawings, and all attachments for execution. Cadify delivers production-ready data, while ERP/MES systems manage operations and routing.
