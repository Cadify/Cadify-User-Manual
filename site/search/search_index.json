Instead of static ranges, lists are filtered in Excel and updated dynamically with each customer choice. This ensures that only valid options are presented and maintained throughout the configuration. In this section, the manual explains the logic, use cases, and configuration steps for implementing dynamic lists.</p> <p>Dynamic lists in Cadify operate by filtering available options in Excel based on the customer\u2019s current selection. Rather than showing all possible sub-variants at once, only the valid subset is displayed and updated interactively. This prevents errors and simplifies the configuration process.</p>      The illustration demonstrates this principle. On the left, a complete list of variants is shown in Excel with both Variant A and Variant B together with their sub-variants. A filter is applied, represented by the funnel, which reduces the list according to the customer\u2019s choice. On the right, the result is a clean table showing only the valid sub-variants of Variant A, in this case, a1, a2, a3.    <p>This mechanism ensures that: Invalid or irrelevant sub-variants are never presented to the customer. Each choice dynamically controls the list shown in the next step. Excel remains the foundation for managing ranges and logic, but Cadify ensures that updates happen instantly in the web interface.</p> <p>By relying on this structured filtering, large and complex product families can be managed without overwhelming the customer.

This calculation combines multiple levels of standardization: geometric definitions such as cylinder length and diameters, material parameters for tubes and rods, and safety factors including friction allowances. In Cadify, these parameters are defined once and then reused across all variants.</p> <p>By embedding such certified engineering methods, Cadify ensures every configured cylinder remains within safe and approved limits.

Instead of static ranges, lists are filtered in Excel and updated dynamically with each customer choice.

Rather than showing all possible sub-variants at once, only the valid subset is displayed and updated interactively. This prevents errors and simplifies the configuration process.</p>      The illustration demonstrates this principle. On the left, a complete list of variants is shown in Excel with both Variant A and Variant B together with their sub-variants. A filter is applied, represented by the funnel, which reduces the list according to the customer\u2019s choice. On the right, the result is a clean table showing only the valid sub-variants of Variant A, in this case, a1, a2, a3.    <p>This mechanism ensures that: Invalid or irrelevant sub-variants are never presented to the customer. Each choice dynamically controls the list shown in the next step. Excel remains the foundation for managing ranges and logic, but Cadify ensures that updates happen instantly in the web interface.</p> <p>By relying on this structured filtering, large and complex product families can be managed without overwhelming the customer.

This section introduces the concept before detailing each numerical type.</p> <p>Example: Hole Count on PCD Numerical controls often need both minimum and maximum values, and these may change dynamically with the geometry. The illustration shows a case where the number of holes on a pitch circle (PCD) depends on hole size and available space.</p>      If the user enters a value above the maximum allowed, the Excel field turns red and a message appears, as shown in the example where 11 holes is outside the valid range of 4\u201310. Cadify then applies a chosen strategy: block the value, suggest a valid alternative, or automatically correct it.    <p>This ensures that inputs always respect physical limits and that the resulting data remains consistent and usable in production.</p>"},{"location":"light/controls/inputNumericalControls/#numerical","title":"Numerical","text":"<p>Simple numeric input.</p> <ul> <li>Example Name: How tall are you</li> <li>Example Value: 1900</li> <li>Unit: mm</li> <li>Min/Max: 0 / 10000</li> <li>Decimal: 0</li> <li>Increment: 1</li> <li>Type: Output</li> </ul>"},{"location":"light/controls/inputNumericalControls/#spinbox-up-down","title":"Spinbox Up Down","text":"<p>Numeric input with increment/decrement buttons.</p> <ul> <li>Example Name: Number A</li> <li>Example Value: 10</li> <li>Unit: mm</li> <li>Min/Max: 1 / 1000</li> <li>Decimal: 0</li> <li>Increment: 1</li> <li>Type: Input</li> </ul>"},{"location":"light/controls/inputNumericalControls/#spinbox-slider","title":"Spinbox Slider","text":"<p>Slider control for numeric input within a range.</p> <ul> <li>Example Name: Number B</li> <li>Example Value: 15</li> <li>Unit: mm</li> <li>Min/Max: 1 / 1000</li> <li>Decimal: 0</li> <li>Increment: 1</li> <li>Type: Input</li> </ul>"},{"location":"light/controls/inputNumericalControls/#list-numeric","title":"List Numeric","text":"<p>Input control for lists of numeric values.</p> <ul> <li>Example Name: Numeric List</li> <li>List Values: 1;2;3;4;5;6;7</li> <li>Unit: mm</li> <li>Type: Input</li> </ul>"},{"location":"light/controls/inputNumericalControls/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"<ul> <li>Min/Max indicates allowed range for numeric controls.</li> <li>Type is either \"Input\" (user provides value) or \"Output\" (value shown to user).</li> <li>Increment/Decimal are relevant for numeric controls to define step size and precision.</li> <li>List Values are separated by semicolons.</li> <li>Controls with Condition or CT Settings may have additional rules for when and how they're displayed or editable.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"light/controls/inputOtherControls/","title":"Input - Other Web Controls","text":"<p>This document provides an overview of the various Other Web Control types, which are not lists or numericals, that you can create to manipulate your product.
